Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

we are the current team developing and maintaining the interactive, life, and self-contained IDE `lively.next`!

This is mainly a collection points for some internal projects with which we wanted to separate from the main organization for organizational reasons.

While you are here, check out the [repository of the project](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.next)! If you think this sounds interesting, feel free to [join our matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#lively.next:matrix.org) - we are always happy to chat! ðŸ™‚

All the best,

Linus & Robin
